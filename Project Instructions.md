Concept
Each teammate will take on an aspect of each ticket to complete. As a team, you will both utilize individual branches to build out your versions of each ticket. Once a ticket is built, as a team, you will then need to merge your code into a main branch.

example:

Sin Ger and Laura are partners

The project will have it's own repo and be represented by the main or master branch.

Sin Ger will create his own branch git checkout -b bob while Sue creates her own branch git checkout -b sue.

When either one completes a ticket, they will push to their branch: git push origin bob.

Whomever is the git master, established at the beginning of the project, they will do a pull request, merging their code to the main/master branch.

Sue will then do a git pull origin main to her branch to obtain the updated code.

Your teams project should start here as the root file.

Stories
These user stories will be a basis as to how the application should work for individuals. These are meant to be broad strokes to the overall build of the application. Consider these regarding both the server and client side aspects.

Send And Receive
Given an empty chat room
When a user types their name into the username field
And types a message into the message field
And clicks the "Send" button
Then the message appears in the chat room with their username
And is written to your Mongo DataBase
Poll for new messages every 10 seconds
Given a new message is sent
Then the client will see it in less than 10 seconds (without clicking Refresh)
Hint:
Use setInterval or setTimeout.
Rooms
In addition to the main room, create at least three different rooms (look to our Discord if you need inspiration)

Given a specific room
When a user is in that specific room
And submits a post
Then the message will appear in that specific room
And not in any other room
And The client should show a list of all available rooms, either in a popup menu or a scrolling list.
Given a user clicks on a link to another room
Then they should see all messages associated with that room in the database.
Tickets
Quick Note: Each ticket will represent up to three parts. A general ticket id will indicate an general requirement. This means that both team members should work together to build it. This can be done via pair programming (where one screen is shared).

If a ticket denotes an "a" or "b" along with its id value, this is meant for an individual student to build.

Example:

U6_01: Both Bob and Sue

U6_01a: Bob

U6_01b: Sue

It is important that commit messages indicate which portion of the ticket you are working through. This will help track your contributions to the overall project.

It should also be noted that the purpose is to assist one another throughout the build as well. This means that if Bob is struggling with the structure of U6_01a, Sue can help resolve the issue through assistance.

Server
Ticket
Spin Up: #U5_01

Application should have all depenedencies associated:
dotenv, express, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt, mongoose, and cors.package.json should detail within the description the team members names.
nodemon should be a devDependency
database connection should be in a separate file db.js.
There should be an example.env to detail what environmental variables are associated within the .env.
node_modules and the .env should not be a part of the GitHub repo.
Models:

Each collection requires a schema associated with this application. There will be:

Users
Message Rooms
Messages
You will need to consider what data types should be associated with a key in each model.

#U5_02 User

username	email	password
required / unique	required / unique	required
#U5_02a Room

Rooms will need to be referenced in the front end for users to navigate to see various messages. Each room will be created by a user, making that user the "admin" who can only update and delete said room.

Users will not be able to update or delete any messages within the room.

The messages key will eventually hold an object of each message so that it can be displayed within the rooms message board.

title	description	messages	ownerId
required / unique	not required	array	id
#U5_02b

Message:
Users should be able to create a messages that are associated with a room.

These messages will be

date	text	owner	room
required	required	id	id
Middleware:
#U5_03

There are various routes that will require validation in order to access.
Controllers:
These are the routes that will be required per schema created.

#U5_04 User

Create an account
Login to an account
#U5_04a Room

Create a room
Get one room
Get all rooms
Update a room
Delete a room
Rooms should only be updated and deleted by the owner. All users should be able to view each room. All users should be able to view a selection of all rooms.

#U5_04b Message

Create a message per room
Get all messages per room
Update message
Delete message
Messages should only be updated and deleted by the owner. All users should be able to see all messages associated within each room.

Ticket Requirements:

Create an assets folder that hold both the collection.json and the environment.json files from Postman.
How to Export/Import from Postman
Stretch Goals:
Note:
Stretch goals should not be attempted until previous tickets have been completed and tested.

#U5_05

Include a project-details.md to the root directory.Create an index.js files to route all models.
Detail the concept of this project in psuedo code within the document.
Pseudo Code Article
Each team member should highlight the portions that they worked through.
Create an index.js files to route all controllers.
Create middleware functions to handle responses for all routes.
Create an index.js file to route all middleware functions.
Regarding the user controller:
Create an Update route.
Create a Delete route.
Regarding the room controller:
Get all rooms per owner.
Regarding the message controller:
Get all messages per owner.
Provide a JSON file from Postman representing both the Collection and Environment for this project.
This needs to be stored within an assets folder.
